== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How are my credits counted? =
WPvivid uses a credit system where optimizing one image size costs one credit. When you upload an image, WordPress will generate 6-10(even more based on the requirements of your themes or plugins) associated images in different resolutions. Then each image size counts as an image. For example, if you upload 10 images, there will be 10 original images showing on our plugin and your WordPress Media Library, and when you choose to optimize all images, the actual number of images that will be optimized will be 60-100, which means 60-100 credits will be used.
= How to save credits? =
To save credits, you can skip and uncheck these images sizes you do not want to optimize from the plugin settings.
= How to avoid double optimizing images and wasting credits? =
The optimized images list is saved in the postmeta table in your WordPress database. If you lose the table or empty the data from the table, the previously optimized images will be recognized as un-optimized, so they will need to be re-optimized, which will cause a waste of credits. It is also best to include the table when migrating the site.
